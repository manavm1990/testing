## Stuff U May Want to Customize

You should just run: `npm run dev` and try things out as is. It's really a nice setup with auto-formatting, auto-saving and just generally a lot of spit set up that you don't need to worry about.

Includes [VS Code Tailwind Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) to auto-complete that spit!
